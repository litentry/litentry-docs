### Concept of Decentralization

The decentralization of Litentry includes following aspects:

* `Decentralization of identity storage`: User data, including identity credential, should be storage in the user's owned devices, instead of the central data server of service provider.

* `Dentralization of idenity authentication`: The identity validator connect to the decentralized network periodically, and it could validate the authentication request independently.

* `Decentralization of identity ownership`: The relationship of data, person, and identity could be validated with cryptographic calculation, and it is also record in the decentralized network instead of regular centralized serviec like Certificate Authority used in HTTPS protocol

* `Decentralization of Identity Data Allocating`: The user data generated when using third party applications/services could be processed by the resolver function on Litentry Network, thus provider user a trustworthy data, with allocate data from multiple applications/services, user are able to create valuable user profile like health info, shopping history, etc.

### Definitions

* `User`: The origin of data, it a person who holds identities or IoT devices. 
* `Identity`: It is a generalized concept of identity, not only include the identity of person, but also any thing could generate claims like IoT devices. A person could own multiple identities, like an identity in Germany, an identity as E-Resident in Estonia, or an identity as an game player.
* `Authorization`: The permission in the reality or the claim in the blockchain world. It is a piece of data that could prove the ownership to a capability or a real thing. Like the permission to read the age data of a person, or the ownership of a 3D printer on a certain day.
* `External Data`: It is the data generated when using the applications/services, like the shopping history when a user shopping in e-store, or the age data read from the aforementioned age proving request.

### Network Interoperability

Based on Substrate Network, Litentry aims to become a fundamental part in the Web3 infrastructure.

// TODO

* `Network Layer`: Polkadot is here to connect different blockchains
* `Runtime Layer`: The Litentry Pallet could be used for other Substrate network builders.
* `Application Layer`: Small business could build smart contract on Litentry network.
